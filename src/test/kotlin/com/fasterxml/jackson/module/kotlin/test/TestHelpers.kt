 * Expect a block to throw an exception.  If a different type of exception is thrown or no
 * exception is produced by the block, fail the test.  In the latter case, no exception being
 * thrown, fixMessage is printed.
 *
 * This function is intended to allow failing tests to be written and run as part of the build
 * without causing it to fail, except if the failure is fixed, in which case the fixMessage
 * should make it clear what has happened (i.e. that some previously broken functionality
 * has been fixed).
 *
 * @param T             The expected throwable
 * @param fixMessage    The message to print when the block succeeds
 * @param block         The block to execute
